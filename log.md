# Experimentation Log

This file is meant to log the development and experimentation process of this project. Please log relevant experiments
including at least a short motivation, the applied commands, and a summary of any relevant outcome or follow-up ideas.

**Usage:** If you want to add content, please create a new section with the current date as heading (if not yet available),
maybe add a subsection with your topic (e.g. NER, CoRef, General, Aggregation, ...) and structure your content in a
meaning full way, e.g.

```markdown

### Relation Extraction

- short experiment to verify that the code for the simple multi-model variant is working
  - preparation: implemented the multi-model variant of the text classification model
  - command: `python src/train.py experiment=tacred +trainer.fast_dev_run=true`
  - wandb (weights & biases) run: https://wandb.ai/arne/pie-example-scidtb/runs/2rsl4z9p (this is just an example!)
  - artefacts, e.g.
    - model location: `path/to/model/dir`, or
    - serialized documents (in the case of inference): `path/to/serialized/documents.jsonl`
  - metric values:
    |          |    f1 |     p |     r |
    | :------- | ----: | ----: | ----: |
    | MACRO    | 0.347 | 0.343 | 0.354 |
    | MICRO    | 0.497 | 0.499 | 0.494 |
  - outcome: the code works
```

IMPORTANT: Execute `pre-commit run -a` before committing to ensure that the markdown is formatted correctly.
